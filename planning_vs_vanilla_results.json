        "plan": "To determine the smallest possible value of \\(a\\) for which all the roots of the polynomial \\(x^3 + ax^2 + ax + 1 = 0\\) are real, we will explore three different approaches:\n\n### Approach 1: Rational Root Theorem and=m\u53ef\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root of the polynomial \\(x^3 + ax^2 + ax + 1 = 0\\) must be a divisor of the constant term (1) divided by a divisor of the leading coefficient (1). The possible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1\\).\n\nLet's test \\(x = 1\\):\n\\[1^3 + a \\cdot 1^2 + a \\cdot 1 + 1 = 1 + a + a + 1 = 2 + 2a.\\]\nFor \\(x = 1\\) to be a root, we need \\(2 + 2a = 0\\), which gives \\(a = -1\\). Since \\(a\\) is a positive real number, \\(a = -1\\) is not a valid solution.\n\nNow, let's test \\(x = -1\\):\n\\[-1^3 + a \\cdot (-1)^2 + a \\cdot (-1) + 1 = -1 + a - a + 1 = 0.\\]\nFor \\(x = -1\\) to be a root, we need \\(0 = 0\\), which is always true. This means \\(x = -1\\) is a root for any value of \\(a\\). If \\(x = -1\\) is a root, the polynomial can be factored as:\n\\[x^3 + ax^2 + ax + 1 = (x + 1)(x^2 + (a-1)x + 1).\\]\nFor the quadratic \\(x^2 + (a-1)x + 1\\) to have real roots, its discriminant must be non-negative:\n\\[(a-1)^2 - 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 \\geq 0,\\]\nwhich simplifies to:\n\\[a^2 - 2a + 1 - 4 \\geq 0,\\]\n\\[a^2 - 2a - 3 \\geq 0.\\]\nFactoring the quadratic expression, we get:\n\\[(a - 3)(a + 1) \\geq 0.\\]\nThe solutions to this inequality are \\(a \\leq -1\\) or \\(a \\geq 3\\). Since \\(a\\) is a positive real number, we have \\(a \\geq 3\\). The smallest possible value of \\(a\\) is therefore \\(3\\).\n\n### Approach 2: Descartes' Rule of Signs\nDes restedch approximate method of finding roots of polynomial equations. It states that the number of positive real roots of a polynomial equation is either equal to the number of sign changes between consecutive non-zero coefficients or less than that by a multiple of 2. For the polynomial \\(x^3 + ax^2 + ax + 1\\), there is exactly one sign change (from \\(a^2\\) to \\(a\\)), indicating there is exactly one positive real root.\n\nNext, we apply Descartes' Rule of Signs to the polynomial with the variable change \\(x = -y\\):\n\\[y^3 - ay^2 - ay + 1.\\]\nCounting the sign changes, we have two sign changes, indicating there are either 2 or 0 negative real roots. Since we already know there is one positive real root, the remaining two roots must be either both negative or one negative and one positive. Therefore, there must be exactly one negative real root for the polynomial to have all real roots.\n\n### Approach 3: refund))\nTo ensure all roots are real, we can analyze the discriminant of the polynomial. The discriminant \\(\\Delta\\) of a cubic polynomial \\(x^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0\\) is given by:\n\\[\\Delta = 18abcd - 4b^3d + b^2c^2 - 4c^3 - 27d^2.\\]\nFor the polynomial \\(x^3 + ax^2 + ax + 1\\), we substitute \\(b = a\\), \\(c = a\\), and \\(d = 1\\):\n\\[\\Delta = 18a \\cdot a \\cdot a \\cdot 1 - 4a^3 \\cdot 1 + a^2 \\cdot a^2 - 4a^3 - 27 \\cdot 1^2 = 18a^4 - 4a^3 + a^4 - 4a^3 - 27 = 19a^4 - 8a^3 - 27.\\]\nFor the polynomial to have all real roots, the discriminant must be non-negative:\n\\[19a^4 - 8a^3 - 27 \\geq 0.\\]\nWe already know from Approach 1 that \\(a \\geq 3\\) is a necessary condition for the polynomial to have all real roots. We can verify that \\(a = 3\\) satisfies this condition:\n\\[19(3)^4 - 8(3)^3 - 27 = 19 \\cdot 81 - 8 \\cdot 27 - 27 = 1539 - 216 - 27 = 1296,\\]\nwhich is positive. Therefore, the smallest possible value of \\(a\\) is \\(3\\).\n\nThe smallest possible value of \\(a\\) is \\(\\boxed{3}\\).",

        "plan": "To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest possible value of \\(a\\) such that all the roots of the polynomial \\(x^3 + ax^2 + ax + 1 = 0\\) are real. Let's explore three distinct approaches to solve this problem.\n\n### Approach 1: Using Calculus\n\nOne way to solve this problem is to use calculus and the properties of polynomials. We can use the fact that if a cubic polynomial has three real roots, its derivative must have two real roots (which correspond to the critical points of the cubic polynomial). Let's start by finding the derivative of the polynomial and analyzing it.\n\nThe polynomial is \\(f(x) = x^3 + ax^2 + ax + 1\\). The derivative is \\(f'(x) = 3x^2 + 2ax + a\\). For \\(f(x)\\) to have three real roots, \\(f'(x)\\) must have two real roots. This means the discriminant of the quadratic equation \\(3x^2 + 2ax + a = 0\\) must be non-negative. The discriminant \\(\\Delta\\) of \\(3x^2 + 2ax + a\\) is given by:\n\\[\n\\Delta = (2a)^2 - 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot a = 4a^2 - 12a = 4a(a - 3).\n\\]\nFor \\(\\Delta \\geq 0\\), we need \\(4a(a - 3) \\geq 0\\). This inequality holds when \\(a \\leq 0\\) or \\(a \\geq 3\\). Since \\(a\\) is a positive real number, we have \\(a \\geq 3\\).\n\n### Approach 2: Using Vieta's Formulas and Symmetric Polynomials\n\nAnother approach is to use Vieta's formulas and properties of symmetric polynomials. Let's denote the roots of the polynomial by \\(r_1, r_2,\\) and \\(r_3\\). By Vieta's formulas, we have:\n\\[\nr_1 + r_2 + r_3 = -a,\n\\]\n\\[\nr_1r_2 + r_2r_3 + r_3r_1 = a,\n\\]\n\\[\nr_1r_2r_3 = -1.\n\\]\nSince all roots are real, we can use the AM-GM inequality to find a lower bound for \\(a\\). Consider the arithmetic mean of the roots:\n\\[\n\\frac{r_1 + r_2 + r_3}{3} = \\frac{-a}{3}.\n\\]\nBy AM-GM inequality:\n\\[\n\\frac{r_1 + r_2 + r_3}{3} \\geq \\sqrt[3]{r_1r_2r_3} = \\sqrt[3]{-1} = -1.\n\\]\nThis gives us:\n\\[\n\\frac{-a}{3} \\geq -1 \\implies a \\leq 3.\n\\]\nThis is the same condition as before. We need to check if \\(a = 3\\) is achievable. If \\(a = 3\\), the polynomial becomes \\(x^3 + 3x^2 + 3x + 1 = (x+1)^3\\), which has a triple root at \\(x = -1\\), satisfying the condition that all roots are real.\n\n### Approach 3: Using Polynomial Factorization\n\nA third approach is to try to factorize the polynomial. Since all roots are real, the polynomial must be factorable into linear factors with real coefficients. Let's assume the polynomial can be written as:\n\\[\n(x - r_1)(x - r_2)(x - r_3) = x^3 + ax^2 + ax + 1.\n\\]\nBy comparing coefficients, we can try to find suitable values for \\(r_1, r_2,\\) and \\(r_3\\). If we try \\(r_1 = r_2 = r_3 = -1\\), we get:\n\\[\n(x + 1)^3 = x^3 + 3x^2 + 3x + 1,\n\\]\nwhich matches the polynomial form when \\(a = 3\\). This confirms that \\(a = 3\\) is indeed the smallest possible value.\n\n### Conclusion\nFrom all three approaches, we see that the smallest possible value of \\(a\\) such that all the roots of the polynomial \\(x^3 + ax^2 + ax + 1 = 0\\) are real is \\(a = 3\\).\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{3}\n\\]",

Plugging these values into the quadratic formula, we get:\n\\[ x = \\frac{7 \\pm \\sqrt{(-7)^2 - 4 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3}}{2 \\cdot 2} = \\frac{7 \\pm \\sqrt{49 - 24}}{4} = \\frac{7 \\pm \\sqrt{25}}{4} = \\frac{7 \\pm 5}{4} \\]\nThis gives us two solutions:\n\\[ x_1 = \\frac{7 + 5}{4} = \\frac{12}{4} = 3 \\]\n\\[ x_2 = \\frac{7 - 5}{4} = \\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{1}{2} \\]\n\nThe sum of the roots is:\n\\[ x_1 + x_2 = 3 + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{6}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{7}{2} \\]\n\n**bounded Strat\u74dcay**\n\nUsing Vieta's formulas, which state that for a quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, the sum of the roots is given by $-\\frac{b}{a}$. For our equation $2x^2 - 7x + 3 = 0$, the sum of the roots is:\n\\[ -\\frac{-7}{2} = \\frac{7}{2} \\]\n\n**factorfactor\u5c0f\u989d\u8d37\u6b3e DirectorLaw \u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0435**\n\nWe can factorize the quadratic equation $2x^2 - 7x + 3 = 0$. We look for two numbers that multiply to $2 \\cdot 3 = 6$ and add up to $-7$. These numbers are $-6$ and $-1$. So we can rewrite the quadratic equation as:\n\\[ 2x^2 - 6x - x + 3 = 0 \\]\n\\[ 2x(x - 3) - 1(x - 3) = 0 \\]\n\\[ (2x - 1)(x - 3) = 0 \\]\n\nSetting each factor to zero gives the roots:\n\\[ 2x - 1 = 0 \\implies x = \\frac{1}{2} \\]\n\\[ x - 3 = 0 \\implies x = 3 \\]\n\nThe sum of the roots is:\n\\[ \\frac{1}{2} + 3 = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{6}{2} = \\frac{7}{2} \\]\n\nIn all three approaches, the sum of the roots of the quadratic equation $2x^2 - 7x + 3 = 0$ is $\\boxed{\\frac{7}{2}}$.",

        "plan": "To find the sum of the roots of the quadratic equation \\(2x^2 - 7x + 3 = 0\\), we can use several different approaches. Let's explore three distinct methods:\n\n### Approach 1: Using Vieta's Formulas\nFor a quadratic equation of the form \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\), Vieta's formulas tell us that the sum of the roots \\(r_1\\) and \\(r_2\\) is given by \\(-\\frac{b}{a}\\). Here, \\(a = 2\\), \\(b = -7\\), and \\(c = 3\\). So, the sum of the roots is:\n\\[\nr_1 + r_2 = -\\frac{-7}{2} = \\frac{7}{2}\n\\]\n\n### Approach 2: Factoring\nWe can factor the quadratic equation \\(2x^2 - 7x + 3 = 0\\) to find the roots. We need to find two numbers that multiply to \\(2 \\cdot 3 = 6\\) and add up to \\(-7\\). These numbers are \\(-6\\) and \\(-1\\). Thus, we can rewrite the quadratic equation as:\n\\[\n2x^2 - 6x - x + 3 = 0\n\\]\nFactoring by grouping, we get:\n\\[\n2x(x - 3) - 1(x - 3) = 0 \\implies (2x - 1)(x - 3) = 0\n\\]\nSetting each factor to zero, we find the roots \\(x = \\frac{1}{2}\\) and \\(x = 3\\). The sum of the roots is:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} + 3 = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{6}{2} = \\frac{7}{2}\n\\]\n\n### Approach 3: Quadratic Formula\nThe roots of a quadratic equation \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\) are given by the quadratic formula \\(x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\). The sum of the roots is the negative of the coefficient of \\(x\\) divided by the coefficient of \\(x^2\\), as with Vieta's formulas. Here, the sum is:\n\\[\nr_1 + r_2 = -\\frac{-7}{2} = \\frac{7}{2}\n\\]\n\nThus, the sum of the roots of the quadratic equation \\(2x^2 - 7x + 3 = 0\\) is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{7}{2}}\\).",
